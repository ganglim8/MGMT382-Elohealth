        <p> Ever since our first medical device launched in 1937, Elohealth has had one goal 
            above all: <b>the highest quality of medical-grade equipment to help service 
            hospitals across the country.</b> Elohealth has since sold thousands of medical equipment
            units to hospitals all over the United States, and has even aquired a 
            medical clinic to better serve its community's medical needs. Elohealth is proud to 
            offer top-rate care in all kinds of medical departments, with world-renowned doctors 
            specializing in fields including: </p>

                <li>Neurology</li>
                <li>Oncology</li>
                <li>Dermatology</li>

                Our founder, James Edward Scott, began this journey upon his graduation from 
                Johns Hopkins University's medical program in 1921. While interning and 
                completing his residency at a hospital in the area, he noticed the 
                inefficiency amongst his fellow doctors due to the rudementary medical equipment
                they were provided with. Scott knew there was a better solution, and after years
                of testing and development alongside a team of medical scientists, Elohealth was 
                born.
